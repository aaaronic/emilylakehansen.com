## About
Emily Lake Hansen (she/her) is a first-year Marion L. Brittain Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. She is the author of the poetry collection Home and Other Duty Stations (Kelsay Books) as well as two chapbooks: The Way the Body Had to Travel (dancing girl press) and Pharaoh's Daughter Keeps a Diary (forthcoming from Kissing Dynamite Press). Her poems and essays have appeared in Hayden's Ferry Review, Pleaides, 32 Poems, OxMag, CALYX, So to Speak, SWWIM, Atticus Review, and Up the Staircase Quarterly among others. A recent finalist for the Black River Chapbook Competition, the C&R Press Poetry Prize, and the Pinch's Page Prize for Nonfiction, Emily's creative work focuses on themes of home and identity as well as the overlaps between personal, ecological, and generational traumas.

Emily has over ten years of experience teaching first-year composition and creative writing at a variety of higher education institions across Georgia, mostly recently at her undergraduate alma mater Agnes Scott College, and also worked as private learning specialist for students with disabilities for five years. Emily holds an M.F.A. in Poetry from Georgia College and a Ph.D. in Creative Writing from Georgia State University where she completed dual dissertations in poetry and creative non-fiction and was a founding editor for Beyond Bars, a literary journal co-created with writers from Philips State Prison. In addition to her creative work, Emily has scholarly interests in disability and fat studies and currently serves as a member of Board of Directors at Atlanta Neighborhood Charter School.
